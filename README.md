## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m **Matheus Hércules**, an Information Security Consultant with experience in **offensive and defensive security**.  
I started my journey in **Blue Team**, working on **Vulnerability Management** and directly engaging with clients to reduce risks and improve security posture. Over time, I evolved into **Red Team operations**, performing realistic attack simulations and measuring the effectiveness of defensive controls.

📌 **Core Expertise:**
- **Vulnerability Management (Qualys, Nessus):** asset classification by business risk, rule/template creation, asset cleanup, tracking remediation with technical teams. Achieved up to **80% risk reduction** across multiple clients.  
- **Red Team & Offensive Security:** attack simulations aligned to **MITRE ATT&CK**, validation of EDR/ SIEM alerts, custom exploit adaptation, automation with Python/Bash/PowerShell.  
- **Threat Intelligence & Dark Web Monitoring:** stealer log analysis, credential exposure monitoring, leakage investigation, supporting proactive risk mitigation.
